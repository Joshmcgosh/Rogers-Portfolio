#Rogers-Portfolio

Hello, for my final project with CS50x, I wanted to create a portfolio showcasing my most recent school work. 

I created a video segment of the final project; You can find the video in the about-me section of my website, which can be found here with this link https://www.youtube.com/embed/izRzKyiAeZ8. The link to my website is here http://box5887.temp.domains/~mrzeppel/portfolio2/.

I decided to redirect users who click on the submit button on the contact portion because I want to direct visitors' attention to my official website.

Thank you for your consideration. 

P.S. Resize the browser less than or equal to 700px to see an effect.
